% Discrete dataset is often collected in experimental physics, sigma
% and probabilities are discrete thus these variables 
% are estimate of real number.
% 1E
% mean or expectation of a Binominal distribution is probability-weighted 
% average of all its possible values. This probability-weight process works
% for both continuous and discrete.
% I think the random variables are continuously changing.  %I don't understand what continuously cganging is. If you zoom your
                                                           %graph, it's stairs shape, the variable x should not be continuous
